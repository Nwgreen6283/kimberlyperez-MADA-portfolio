While most folks associate Salmonella with raw poultry or even peanut butter, a rising subset of cases is actually linked to environmental factors.

    "text": "Course Goals\nMy first introduction to programming was during the first semester of my MPH. My class learned how to run a few lines of code using STATA. I also learned some basic functions on SAS. However, the bulk of my experience comes from Dr. Bahl’s EPID 7500 class. That was my first true introduction to R. While that semester was a whirlwind of Googling, I was happy with the content I created.\nFrom this course I hope to gain a greater understanding of the R language and the packages that will help me analyze my data, appropriate statistical models to run based on specific data, and how to better interpret results."

The hosts Roger and Hilary discuss all things data science and analysis. Besides this, I cannot provide much more insight as I am only a couple episodes in. However, I am pretty intrigued so far and think this will be my go to podcast this semester. Enjoy!"
